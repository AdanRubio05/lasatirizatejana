<h2>Violent Night</h2>
<h3>1/5 rating</h3>
<p>Stupid. I've seen Mall Santa fights that were more entertaining than this. I'd rather drink expired curdled eggnog while having Rudolph the Red Nosed Reindeer projectile vomit gingerbread and elf s*%t all over my face than see this movie again. Honestly, I don't know who the hell this was for.</p><br>
<p>I mean if you ever wanted to see Santa Claus curse, drink, and shoot people with guns this picture is for you. Otherwise, I'd stick to those films like "Jack Frost" or "Krampus".</p>

<h2>Tulsa King</h2>
<h3>4/5 Rating</h3>
<p>Look, I know this ain't a movie but hear me out! One thing is still for certain when it comes to actor Sylvester Stallone. His smoking addiction has gotten worse. Each year his voice sounds even more raspy. Compared to Stallone, Nina Blackwood from Sirius XM sounds like a ASMR artist who role plays as the "cool" librarian who doesn't care about their job anymore.</p><br>
<p>Basically, Stallone plays a mobster who shows up announced in Tulsa, Oklahoma. Suprised and relieved that they didn't get Robert DeNiro for the upteenth time playing a mobster. Then again, Mr. DeNiro is just as incomprehensible as Mr. Stallone but that's what happens when you star in countless boxing dramas and action thrillers, making a living being punched in the head and all. I'm convinced in about 70% of Stallone's scenes he had to dub his lines over himself.</p><br>
<p>All in all, though the show only has three episodes thus far as I'm typing (11/30/22), it's got off to a strong start. Stronger than Stallone as the show doesn't require steroids.</p>
