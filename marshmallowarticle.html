<h2>Texan Art Center Blown Up by Marshmallows to address global climate change</h2>
<p align= "left">In what authorities are calling a freak disaster of mass proportion, The San Antonio Museum of Art was nearly destroyed entirely after a protest demonstration.</p><br>
<p align= "left">At precisely 11:00 am; central time; 10:00 am; mountain time; 8:00 am; Alaskan time, three suspects wearing plain t-shirts and dyed hair, which made them look like aneroxic smurfs, had entered the "Latin-American" exhibit. Two of which were carrying large crates and the other a long wire. The three then approached the very corner where the "La Malinche" painting was on display. In front of multiple and shocked museum patrons, one of them threw marshmallow sauce onto the painting. According to an eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, the protester yelled, "Texas!! What do you value more!? Oil or your citizens?!" The eyewitness then remarked that, "I assume that's what she was going to say because she stopped at the word 'oil' after one of the others said, 'Oh crap! I set it too early!'" Those final words sealed their fate as the crates, which contained a mixture of marshmallow and composition c-4, had exploded prematurely before the protestors would have a chance to escape.</p>
	<br>
<p align= "left">The explosion was so grand that the marshmallow covered debri had been launched an estimated ten mile radius outside the museum property. The damage to the museum building itself was suprisingly minimal as the marshmallows had managed to cushion the shockwave of the explosion. However, the same could not be said for the priceless artworks and people who were unlucky to still be present within the building. Many artworks are beyond repair or completely ruined by the marshmallow residue. Most if not all patrons inside the museum nearly suffocated under the sugary white flubber. Some, including the protesters, were pinned and stuck onto the walls of the museum.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
<p align= "left">"Looking on the brightside, I have gained two new things", said the museum's curator, "First, I've strengthened my relationship with the community." The museum's curator is offering the people of San Antonio to stop by the museum for an all you can eat marshmallow buffet. As having it removed by machines would be too costly and seeing that it would "be such a waste to not eat that marshmallow". As for the protestors, they are to await being arrested for criminal mischief and disturbing the peace as soon as the museum's curator decides to remove them from the walls. When asked why he deliberately chose not to get the three off the wall she said, "They wanted to destroy an exhibit to leave their mark. Now, they <i>can be the exhibit itself</i>. I'm calling it 'Confectionary Choafs'.</p>
<p align= "left">The Confectionary Choafs exhibit will be open for the remainder of the December month</p>
