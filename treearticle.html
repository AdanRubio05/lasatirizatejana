<h2>Chrismas Trees share perspective on the Christmas Season</h2>
<p align= "left">The tradition of decorating a tree with eye catching ornaments and LED lights during the winter solstice is a custom that traces all the way back to the Pagans. Well...with the exception of them not having LED lights...they were too stupid to figure that out yet. The most common tree seen around the Christmas season is a pine tree. With the exception of occasionally seeing a Abies procera or Pseudotsuga menziesii. Though, not many of us stop to really look and think about these trees. Or question the ethics of us tearing them from the soil to be propped up in the corner of a cramped apartment kitchen. Or at the center of an over-bearingly obnoxious and busy mall.</p>
<br>
<p align= "left">The point is, do we ever ask: Did the trees consent to being Christmas decorations?</p>
	
<p align= "left">Granted, not many can speak to the trees like Danny DeVito or Kadie Karen Diemeyer can. That is no excuse however to not at least attempt to really dig down and ask these trees for their perspective. Which is exactly what our reporter, Toro Caganer, did.</p>
