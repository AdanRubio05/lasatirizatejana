<h2>Texan Legislate pushing for the lifting of Heat seeking<br>Rocket Launcher Permits</h2>
<p align= "left">The recent bill which became state law on September 1st, 2022 had garnered mixed reaction from many Texan residents. A few celebrated that the premitless law for hanguns had allowed them to embrace their second amendment right. Some newly encouraged newbies even remarked how they were glad that they no longer have to consider spending extra money on learning how to properly fire a firearm in now extinct mandatory courses provided by the state. Some question and even worry about the consequences of such a bill becoming law. Particulary law enforcement, educators, parents, brothers, sisters, aunts, uncles, cousins, granparents, newlyweds, construction workers, retail workers, the governor's assistant, the governor's therapist, the treasurer, cattle drivers, truck drivers, screwdrivers, and that one crackhead who lives by the railroad tracks.</p>

<p align= "left">However, a new proposal had come up in the Texan Capitol. It had all the legislators twirling their revolvers and firing them rapidly up at the ceiling. The proposal advocates that not only handguns be void of a permit requirement but that heatseeking rocket launchers are to be freely carried in the streets of Texan communities as well. "This would be a monumental change for Texas", Senator Cy Gogh exclaimed as he reloaded, "With the passing of this bill, we can further expand the diversity of choice when it comes to what weapons Texans want to carry on their person". Senator Cy Gogh went on to say, "Too many laws have barred citizens from carrying weapons for their own self defense. We want to inspire our fellow states to provide equitable gun access, regardless if you're a convicted felon or deranged twenty year old, everyone has the right to bare arms to provide for the common defense". When asked why he would support such a bill to be passed he replied, "Houston gets to launch rockets. Why can't the average Jane or Joe do it too? Besides there's nothin' better than blasting the crap outta somethin'!" We asked Senator Cy Gogh for further comment on what they're doing on improving and encouraging the background check process for Texas. Senator Cy Gogh provided no comment as he had no knowledge on what a background check was.</p>

<p align= "left">Moving to one of the most important voices of opinion, Texan Citizens. What do they make of this bill? "I had saved up all summer for an automatic but hearing that I'd have fees from training courses and licensing was a total bummer", said Kenny Piedmont, who had just moved to Ft. Worth after graduating the San Francisco School of Arts, "Then the passing of this new bill had me clicking my heels! I mean, who wouldn't want to be able to just buy a handgun and get to carrying it!? I feel like I'm finally becoming a real Texan now!" Mr. Piedmont went on to support the idea of being able to carry a rocket launcher over his shoulder. "It'd be cool to even have it sitting in my low ride crew cab while out with my homies!", Mr. Piedmont giggled. Unfortunately, we couldn't get further comment on the proposed rocket launcher permit lift. Mr. Piedmont is currently in critical condition at the hospital after accidentally shooting himself with his own gun whilst trying to impress a couple of women outside of the Cattlemens Steakhouse's parking lot. His firearm will be seized after having just purchased it half an hour from our interview.</p>
<br>
<p align= "left">"Personally, I'd be all for it", said Myron Steis, an employee of a local steel distribution office, "I'm a father of three and married...I could finally show those animals how to show me respect".<br>"I just want it to stop", said officer Lupe Ramirez, "whatever happened to my routine traffic stops?"</p>
