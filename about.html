However, this doesn't discourage him from wanting to bring you (the viewers) quality satirical entertainment through writing and cartoons.<br><br>You having a hard day and need something to laugh at? This site will deliver! Lookin' for someone to poke fun at recent events in the news? This site will deliver! Lookin' to see some quality cartoon comic strips with stupid jokes? Need it be said again? THis. Site. Will. Deliver. <br><br> So whatta waiting for!? Click any of the tabs above!! </h2>
