<h2>Easy holiday Cake Recipe</h2>
<p>We all know that the holiday season is approaching fast. Especially by October 1st. So, why not celebrate with this fun recipie? No baking or eggs required!</p><br>
<p align= "left">You Will Need:</p>
<p align= "left">Two Hands,&nbsp;A method of transportation,&nbsp;At least $15 cash,&nbsp;A favorite cake flavor.</p><br>
<p>Instructions</p><br>
<p align= "left">When you decide what kind of cake flavor you want, walk outside your home to your car. If you do not own an automobile, substitute by taking the public bus, metro, or a taxi service. With either method you should make your way to the nearest grocery store. When you arrive, enter the store and walk to the bakery section of the store. Usually, it is located near the deli or fresh produce section of the grocery store. Once there, order the cake of your choosing. Remember, it can be any flavor, size, or shape. After arguing with the employee about the screw up on the frosting decoration, purchase the cake and leave the store. Once home, cake is ready for serving and immediate consumption. Finally, after eating half of the cake by yourself and putting it in the fridge, go back to your bedroom and lie face down in your pillow. Then cry yourself to sleep because you can't even crack a f%#king egg!</p>
<p>Happy Holidays from La Satiriza Tejana!</p>
