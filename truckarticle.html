<h2>Commercial Truck Driver makes extra profit by offering mobile transporTation<br>services to illegal aliens</h2>
<p align= "left">Dick Raj makes a living by hauling for big e-commerce companies. His route starts from Laredo, TX all the way to Los Angeles, CA and back! With recent political and economical factors, good truck drivers are far and few. With the veteran truck drivers being paid too little for the monotonous ride ahead. Dick Raj however is a man of innovation and found a side hustle that correlates perfectly with his job.</p>
<br>
<p align= "left">"Laredo is crawlin' with em!", said Mr. Raj, "I used to have to electrify the truck frame so they wouldn't climb on. I wish somebody woulda told me 'bout them apps like Oobie (Uber) and Lyft. These guys will pay <i>ANYTHING</i> to get a ride." Within just the span of a week, Mr. Dick Raj can transport forty five illegal migrants a day from Laredo to various places in the United States. "On most days I can make almost an additional two grand a day with these mobile taxi services", Mr. Raj, "I'll take 'em anywhere. Most of the time I pick 'em up at the gas station or truck stops at night. I don't know how they get the money from pesos to dollars but a lot of 'em carry blocks of flour or somethin'."</p>
	<br>
<p align= "left">We asked Mr. Raj if he worries about getting into legal trouble transporting illegal aliens throughout the nation. To which he said, "Oh not at all! Hell, I ain't gonna get in no trouble...least I don't think so. Most of my passengers leave pretty quick anyhow. They either go into an unmarked car or bus then leave. Sometimes I see them go right into an alleyway once I drop 'em off at the nearest town." Mr. Raj went on to state, "I don't care what anybody thinks. If these guys make money on the side why can't I?" Mr. Raj's CDL is currently suspended as he is investigated.</p>
